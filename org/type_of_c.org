it is a summary of the difference between float and double.

float have four bytes, while double have eight bytes. so if we want to accurate computing sth, we'd
better use double. but double will need more place to store numbers, and it will need more time to computing,
so we'd better choose the best type of C to get the result we want.

Float takes up four bytes of storage, while double takes up eight bytes. Therefore, if we want accurate computations, we should use double. However, double will require more space to store 
numbers and will take more time to compute. Therefore, we should choose the appropriate data 
type in C to obtain the desired result.
